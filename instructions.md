Your NFT collection is getting a little stale. You’ve been eyeing a few NFTs that are off the market. How do you spice up your collection? You resort to your favorite guilty habit: gambling! 

1. The game is a PvP NFT coin toss. To initialize the game, the creator provides the NFT they are betting and the number of NFTs (one or more) from the same collection that the opponent needs to bet to enter the game. 
NFTs can vary significantly in rarity, which is why the game creator is given the option to require opponents to put multiple NFTs on the line. You wouldn’t want to risk a rare piece for a single floor piece. This option is a way of introducing “odds” into the game. The game is fair, insofar as the perceived value of the NFTs on each side is equal.
2. Anyone can join an open game by depositing their NFTs according to the game’s requirements, i.e. the specified number of NFTs from the specified NFT collection. All NFTs from the collection are fair game. As soon as an opponent joins, the game is ready.
3. The contract flips a fair coin to determine the winning player, and records the winner. The winner is then able to collect their NFTs using Claim. Anyone can call this function.
4. The game creator can cancel the game at any time, insofar as no opponent has joined. If an opponent has joined the game, the only way to settle it is by running it.
5. Upon winning the game, the winner can claim their NFTs.
